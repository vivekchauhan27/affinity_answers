Q1 . I am searching for a "Car Cover" on OLX - using www.olx.in/items/q-car-cover; write a python program that gives me the search results in a file.
annswer- consider file olx_scrapper.ipynb and olx_data.csv ,use randomised header for accessing the page

Q2. Write a shell script to extract Scheme Name and Asset Value from https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt and save as TSV. Should this data be in JSON instead?
answer- consider files extract_nav.sh and nav_data.tsv.TSV format is best if you want to open in Excel, Google Sheets, pandas, or do quick analysis.
JSON is best if you want to expose it through an API, load it in a web/app project.
